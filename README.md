# wonderFULLreadmeFileMaker
This project is designed to write a README file for its users. Let's make life easy! Less time on a README means more time for coding, right? Get focused and work harder. This is what makes technology better: more idle time to think of new, better versions of applications!

### Process/Motivation
As a creative writer, I have a tendency to say *a lot* of things all the time; sometimes it's even on topic! That said, a README is meant to be a technical document. This generator is designed to keep my words on task. 

Ultimately, this was a rewarding assignment that has made my life much easier. I look forward to applying these methods to other projects. 

## Challenges
The challenge is that I, Robin, have the attention span of a cracked out, suicidal squirrel. Additionally, I struggled with setting parameters on the functions. I look forward to revising these to run more efficiently in the future.
